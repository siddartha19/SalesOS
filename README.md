# OpenSales

> Your AI sales team that runs outbound end-to-end.

A multi-agent outbound sales system. Paste an ICP. A VP-of-Sales agent plans the campaign, an SDR agent finds target companies and decision-makers, an AE agent enriches contacts and writes personalized cold emails using fresh signal from LinkedIn and the open web. You review the drafts and click send. Every prospect lands in a Google Sheet pipeline. Every agent step is traced with token cost and latency.

## Why OpenSales

Outbound sales is one of the most expensive functions a startup runs. A single SDR today costs $6k–$1 K lakhs/year. Most early-stage founders do it themselves and lose 10-15 hours a week to prospecting and writing cold emails. The work is real, the work is repetitive, and the work is exactly what AI agents can now do well.

OpenSales replaces the SDR + AE pair with two specialist agents and a manager that reviews their output. It works on real public data (LinkedIn, web search, B2B people databases) and sends real emails through real transports. No simulated paths anywhere.

The whole thing runs locally. You ship outbound from your own machine, with your own SendGrid sender, your own pipeline sheet, and your own LLM key. No SaaS lock-in.

## What it does

- **Discover companies** matching your ICP via Exa neural search.
- **Find decision-makers** at each company via Crustdata's people search.
- **Enrich contacts** with verified emails and rich profile data via Crustdata.
- **Pull LinkedIn signal** (About section, recent posts, experience) via Apify, with a 24-hour cache and automatic Exa fallback when the scrape times out.
- **Draft personalized cold emails** that quote something the prospect actually said or did in the last few weeks. No "I hope this email finds you well." No "circling back." A 10-case eval set enforces it.
- **Send via SendGrid** straight from the approval queue, with status, message ID, and any errors surfaced inline.
- **Log to Google Sheets** with a 7-stage pipeline (`Sourced → Researched → Outreach Sent → Replied → Qualified → Demo Booked → Lost`).
- **Trace every agent step** in a custom observability UI: tree view, per-step token cost, expandable prompts, total $ per campaign.
- **Handle objections** when a prospect replies — paste the reply, the AE drafts a non-defensive response in seconds.

Built on [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)'s supervisor pattern. The VP delegates to specialists by name. Each specialist has only the tools it needs.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Node.js 20+
- ngrok ([download](https://ngrok.com/download)) — only if you want a public URL for the demo
- API keys for: OpenRouter, Crustdata, Exa, Apify, SendGrid
- A Google Cloud service account with Sheets API enabled
- A target Google Sheet, shared with the service account email

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/opensales.git
cd opensales

# Backend
cd backend
uv sync

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Symlink env
cd frontend && ln -s ../.env .env.local
```

### Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:

```bash
# LLM via OpenRouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
LLM_MODEL=google/gemini-2.0-flash-001

# People sourcing
CRUSTDATA_API_KEY=...

# Web signal
EXA_API_KEY=...

# LinkedIn enrichment (cached 24h)
APIFY_API_TOKEN=apify_api_...
APIFY_LINKEDIN_ACTOR_ID=apify~linkedin-profile-scraper

# Outreach
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=you@yourdomain.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Your Name

# Pipeline
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1abc...xyz
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=./service_account.json

# Auth (hardcoded credential pair for demo)
AUTH_EMAIL=hr@yourdomain.com
AUTH_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123
AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

### Run

Three terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: FastAPI backend
cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Next.js frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3 (optional): public URL via ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your ngrok URL). Login with `AUTH_EMAIL` / `AUTH_PASSWORD`. Paste an ICP. Hit Run.

### Pre-warm the LinkedIn cache (optional, for demo)

Apify LinkedIn scrapes take 10-30 seconds. For a smooth demo, pre-scrape your known prospects:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python scripts/prewarm.py
```

Edit the `DEMO_RECIPIENTS` list in `prewarm.py` first.

---

## Usage

### Web UI

1. Login.
2. Paste an ICP. Example: *"Indian AI startup founders, Series A or earlier, raised in 2024-2025, building agent products."*
3. Click **Run sales team**.
4. Watch live activity. SDR returns 8 prospect cards in ~10 seconds.
5. Select 3 prospects. Click **Draft outreach**.
6. AE drafts personalized emails (cached LinkedIn = ~2s, live = ~25s).
7. Review each draft. Edit if needed. Click **Approve & Send**.
8. Check the Google Sheet. Open the trace UI to see exactly what each agent did and what it cost.

### CLI

```bash
cd backend
uv run python -m app.cli "Indian AI startup founders, Series A, building agent products"
```

### Objection handling

Paste a reply into the objection box. AE drafts a response that addresses the concern without being defensive. Common cases handled: "we already use X", "not the right time", "send me more info", "remove me from your list."

## Eval

Cold email quality is enforced by a 10-case eval set in `backend/evals/cold_email_quality.json`. Each case defines must-include patterns (specific quote from prospect activity, under 100 words, specific subject) and anti-patterns ("I hope this email finds you well", "circling back", emoji on a non-emoji prospect).

Run:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python -m evals.run
```

Output: pass/fail per case, % pass, flagged anti-patterns. Run before and after every prompt change.

## Roadmap

Things this v0 does NOT do, and roughly when they'd land:

- [ ] **Real reply handling via SendGrid Inbound Parse webhooks.** Currently you paste replies manually.
- [ ] **Multi-channel outreach** (LinkedIn DM, WhatsApp). Email-only today.
- [ ] **Follow-up sequences** (day 3, day 7 nudges).
- [ ] **Sales Engineer agent** for technical discovery questions.
- [ ] **CSM agent** for post-deal handoff and onboarding.
- [ ] **Multi-user / role-based access.** Hardcoded single-user auth today.
- [ ] **Production deployment** (Fly.io / Render / Vercel split).
- [ ] **A/B testing** of subject lines via the eval pipeline.
- [ ] **Reply tracking** + auto-stage transitions in the pipeline sheet.
- [ ] **Calendar integration** for "book a demo" flow.

PRs welcome. Pick a checkbox.

## Design choices worth knowing

A few non-obvious calls in the v0:

- **Apify is wrapped in a cache + fallback.** LinkedIn scrapers are slow (10-30s) and unreliable (~20% failure). The `apify.py` service caches 24h and falls back to Exa on timeout. The trace UI shows source (`apify_cache` vs `apify_live` vs `exa_fallback`) so you always know where signal came from.
- **Custom observability beats wiring Langfuse.** SQLite + a React tree view ships in 90 minutes and gets you the same diagnostic power. No vendor lock-in, no auth setup, no separate dashboard.
- **The VP agent reviews drafts before send.** Not just for safety. The review step is what stops AI slop. If a draft has any anti-pattern, the VP sends it back to the AE with feedback.
- **Every send is reviewed before it goes out.** The VP agent and the human-in-the-loop approval queue both gate the SendGrid call. No background blasts.
- **One LLM provider.** OpenRouter fronts ~50 models with one API key, one billing dashboard, one SDK. Swap models with one env var without rewriting agent code.


## License

MIT. Use it. Sell it. Modify it. Just don't blame me when SendGrid suspends your account for sending 10,000 cold emails on day one.
